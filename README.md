# World Population (EDA) 

## Introduction

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the World Population dataset. The dataset provides insights into the global population across countries and continents over several decades. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and can be viewd here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset

## Getting Started

In this section, we import the necessary Python libraries to perform data analysis and create visualizations. These libraries include Pandas for data manipulation, Seaborn for data visualization, and Matplotlib for plotting graphs.

## Data Exploration

The data exploration phase begins by importing the World Population dataset and displaying its initial rows. We also format the floating numbers to show two decimal places for clarity.

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning section checks for null values in the dataset and confirms that there are no missing values. Additionally, we explore the dataset to identify unique values within it.

## Visualizations

This part of the code creates various visualizations to help us understand the dataset:

1. A heatmap of correlation within the dataset, which shows how different attributes are related.
2. A graph displaying the mean population growth by continent, giving insights into population trends.
3. A boxplot to illustrate the distribution of data in the dataset, highlighting any outliers.
   
## Questions

The code answers specific questions related to the dataset:

1. What are the most and least populated countries in 2022.
2. Analyzing the change in global population distribution across continents from 1970 to 2022.
3. Determining which countries have experienced the most significant population growth and decline from 2015 to 2022.
4. The answers to these questions are provided through data analysis and visualizations.

## Data Export

The dataset containing the average population growth by continent from 1970-2022 is exported to a CSV file named 'Continents.csv' for further analysis or reporting.
